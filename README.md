## Directory Information

- `components` - The `components` folder in the `alumni` repository is where you provided contains JavaScript files that define components for the application.

- `pages` - The `pages` folder in the `alumni` repository is where you define the routes for your application. Each file in the pages folder corresponds to a specific route, and the contents of that file will be rendered when a user navigates to that route.

- `public` - The `public` folder in the `alumni` repository serves as a static directory that is available to the client-side. This means that any files placed in this folder can be accessed by the client-side code.

- `styles` - The `styles` folder in the `alumni` repository is where you can store your CSS files. Next.js automatically processes these files and applies them to your project.

## License
The alumni repository is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for more information.
